# Nuxt Content simple starter updated

While playing around with the Nuxt Content blog I noticed that the order of the blog posts wasn't kept in ascending or descending order. It was working fine when all blog posts were created in May but adding a blog post in June messed the order up.

We pasted below code in the Markdown files:

```
---
title: First Post.....Nuxt
description: First description Nuxt
createdAt: "May 28, 2022"
---

# My first Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my first blog post using Nuxt!
```

```
---
title: Second Post.....Nuxt
description: Second description Nuxt
createdAt: "May 29, 2022"
---
# My second Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my second blog post using Nuxt!
```

```
---
title: 3th Post.....Nuxt
description: 3th description Nuxt
createdAt: "May 30, 2022"
---
# My 3th Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my 3th blog post using Nuxt!
```
---

However with the date formatted like this the sort method on the queryContent function is not able to do it's work as it is supposed to. It's not able to sort in a descending or ascending order. See below code to check how queryContent and sort looks.

```ts
<script setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData("blog", () =>
  queryContent("/").sort({ createdAt: 0 }).find()
);
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="blog in data" :key="blog.id">
      <NuxtLink :to="blog._path">
        <h1>{{ blog.title }}</h1>
      </NuxtLink>
      <h2>{{ blog.description }}</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

So we have to change the date format of our createdAt property in the .md files in order for the sort method to work properly. Replace the code in the .md files with below code.

```

# My 3th Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my 3th blog post using Nuxt!
```

Paste below code in the index.vue file and observe that we run into a new issue now that we are displaying the date the blog was written.

```ts
<script setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData("blog", () =>
  queryContent("/").sort({ createdAt: 0 }).find()
);
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="blog in data" :key="blog.id">
      <NuxtLink :to="blog._path">
        <h1>{{ blog.title }}</h1>
      </NuxtLink>
      <h2>{{ blog.description }}</h2>
      <p>{{ blog.createdAt }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

As a developer we don't want to display the date like that on screen as it is an awful user experience. Let's change our code in the index.vue file to solve this problem. See the code below and paste it in, replacing what you currently have in index.vue

```ts
<script setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData("blog", () =>
  queryContent("/blog").sort({ createdAt: 0 }).find()
);

const date = (value) =>
  new Date(value).toLocaleDateString("en-us", {
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    year: "numeric",
  });

const blogs = data.value.map((blog) => ({
  title: blog.title,
  description: blog.description,
  createdAt: date(blog.createdAt),
}));
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="blog in blogs" :key="blog.id">
      <NuxtLink :to="blog._path">
        <h1>{{ blog.title }}</h1>
      </NuxtLink>
      <h2>{{ blog.description }}</h2>
      <p>{{ blog.createdAt }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
And now the date looks a lot better on screen.

In index.vue we created an arrow function called date, that transforms the not user friendly date into a readable format. Than we mapped over the data array changing the value of the createdAt to our new date format. In the v-for directive in the template we changed data to blogs as we don't map over data anymore but over our new created array named blogs.

We can shorten the blogs arrow function a bit using the spread operator. See below code.

```ts
const blogs = data.value.map((blog) => ({
  ...blog,
  createdAt: date(blog.createdAt),
}));
```

And that's it for now. You can find the full repository [here](https://github.com/jeroen-engineer/nuxt-content-simple-blog-starter).
