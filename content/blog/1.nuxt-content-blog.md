# My first Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my first blog post using Nuxt!

First of all, what an amazing developer experience playing around with Nuxt. Haven't touched Nuxt before, but as I'm learning, developing and just having fun with Vue.js for a couple of months now, I decided to have a look at Nuxt. Nuxt3 release candidate came out a few weeks ago and this week NuxtContent saw the light so I thought: "Let me see what that is and build something."

## What is Nuxt?

Well, according to their [website](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/introduction) it's goal is:

Nuxt's goal is to make web development intuitive and performant with a great developer experience in mind.
::

On this [same page](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/introduction) it reads:
## Why Nuxt?
To understand what Nuxt is, we need to understand what we need to create a modern application:

::list
- A JavaScript framework to bring reactivity and web components, we chose Vue.js .
- A bundler to support hot module replacement in development and bundle your code for production, we support both webpack 5 and Vite .
- A transpiler to write the latest JavaScript syntax while supporting legacy browsers, we use esbuild for that.
- A server for serving your application in development, but also to support server-side rendering or API routes, Nuxt uses h3 for deployment versatility such as serverless, workers, Node.js and unmatched performance.
- A routing library to handle client-side navigation, we chose vue-router.

Nuxt takes care of this so you can focus on what matters: creating your web application.

Go check it out on their [website](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/), the documentation is clear, concise and just great.

## What is Nuxt Content?
Nuxt Content is a Nuxt module that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV and JSON files in the content/ directory. To start using NuxtContent just install Nuxt Content (npm i @nuxt/content) in your Nuxt3 project.

## Let's create a Nuxt3 Content project together

First of all, open a terminal at the root of the folder you want to create your project. In my case I have a myblog_playground folder inside my Documents folder. Run below command. Follow the instructions in your terminal. See picture.

```
npx nuxi init nuxt-app
```
![terminal](/images/blog1/image1.png)

Open the project in vscode and toggle the built-in terminal. Run the below command. See picture.

```
npm i @nuxt/content
```

![terminal-vscode](/images/blog1/image2.png)

Now in the root of the project create a content and a pages directory.

![create-directories](/images/blog1/image3.png)

In the content directory create three files.

```
 1.blog-post1.md
 2.blog-post2.md
 3.blog-post3.md
 ```

 In the pages directory create two files. 

```
[...slug].vue
index.vue
```

![create-directories](/images/blog1/image4.png)

Paste below code into 1.blog-post1.md

```

# My 3th Nuxt blog post

Welcome to my 3th blog post using Nuxt!
```

Paste below code into ```[...slug].vue```


```html
<template>
  <main>
    <ContentDoc class="prose" />
  </main>
</template>
```

Paste below code into index.vue

```ts
<script setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData("blog", () =>
  queryContent("/").sort({ createdAt: 0 }).find()
);
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="blog in data" :key="blog.id">
      <NuxtLink :to="blog._path">
        <h1>{{ blog.title }}</h1>
      </NuxtLink>
      <h2>{{ blog.description }}</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Replace the code in nuxt.config.ts with below code.

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from "nuxt";
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@nuxt/content"],
  content: {
    // https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration
  },
});
```

Replace the code in app.vue with below code.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```

Now run:

```
npm run dev
```

![npmrunserve](/images/blog1/image5.png)

If everything is ok you should see the same as in below picture.

![successerver](/images/blog1/image6.png)

Now follow the link in the terminal and visit http://localhost:3000/ . If everything went fine you will see below picture.

![localhost](/images/blog1/image7.png)

That's it. Now you're ready to build and style the app you want. Have fun coding!
